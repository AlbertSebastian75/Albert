# I created this website all by myself when I was pursuing my degree. It might have a few disadvantages, such being unattractive and unresponsive, so I recommend to use a laptop instead of a mobile device to view the site. Through this website project, I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and MySQL.

# Hosting
Create an AWS EC2 Instance and Connect to the Remote Desktop Protocol. Then Set Up the Project and Configure Security for necessary incoming and outgoing traffic.
